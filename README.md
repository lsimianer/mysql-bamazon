# Bamazon a Lukas Simianer app
##Unoriginally named, originally stocked

Bamazon is a an app using multiple NPM libraries (all listed with links at the bottom for your own use) which takes a database accesed through [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and brought to the command line using Javascript and [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

## The Process
1: Create a database: I did this in VS code with the SQL plugin as it maade cathcing errors while learning the new language a lot easier and my time utilization more focused on learning. 
2: Test your Database: I copied my VS code into the  Mysql Workbench and then ran a couple simple queries to confirm its formatting and success.
3: Accesing your database in the command line: This requires creating a Javascript document and utilizing the Node JS library. I Developed and tested the code in the command line and this was the most time consuming part of the project.
4: Formatting your command line app: I used cli-table and NPM colors along with Inquirer for the prompts.
5: Testing and being proud: This is an important step, when all your work is done ensure you take a step back and feel some pride in what you've learned and built. In the bootcamp environment its easy to rob yourself of these victories as its constantly on to the next assignment. I'm proud of this and what I've learned in such a short time.
